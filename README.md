🔹 Step-by-step Functionality
1. Takes Input from the User
    The program asks the user to enter:
      The first number
      The second number
    Both inputs are converted into integers using int().
2. Performs Arithmetic Operations
    After receiving the two numbers, the program calculates:
      Addition → a + b
      Substraction → a - b
      Multiplication → a * b
      divison → a / b
3. Displays the Results
    The results of all four operations are printed on the screen using the print() function.
